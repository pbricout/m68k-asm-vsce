</head><body><h1>MC68000 Instructions timing</h1>
<pre>To calculate the timings of most 68000 instructions, you will need to first
find the number of cycles used by the addressing mode in the table below
('Effective Address Operand Calculation Timing') and then the timing for
the actual instruction in the appropriate table.

Effective Address Operand Calculation Timing

This table lists the number of clock periods required to compute an
instruction's effective address. It includes fetching of any extension
words, the address computation , and fetching of the memory operand.
The number of bus read and write cycles is shown in parenthesis as (r/w).
Note there are no write cycles involved in processing the effective address.

xxx.W	 absolute short				 8(2/0)		12(3/0)
xxx.L	 absolute long				12(3/0)		16(4/0)
d(PC)	 program counter with displacement	 8(2/0)		12(3/0)
d(PC,ix) program counter with index		10(2/0)		14(3/0)
#xxx	 immediate				 4(1/0)		 8(2/0)

The size of the index register (ix) does not affect execution time
