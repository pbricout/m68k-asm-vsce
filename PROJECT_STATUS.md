# M68K Assembly Extension - Project Status

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** June 4, 2025  
**Version:** 1.8.0+  
**Health Score:** 100%

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Include Functionality Bug Fix (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: Include statements like `include ASM_LIBS\MACROS.I` were being detected but file resolution was failing
- **Root Cause**: Windows backslash normalization in `resolveIncludePath` function was breaking path resolution
- **Solution**: Enhanced path resolution using `path.resolve()` for proper cross-platform handling
- **Status**: Fully tested and verified working

### 2. ✅ Project Organization & Cleanup (COMPLETE)
- **Before**: Test files scattered throughout project root
- **After**: Comprehensive organized test structure:
  ```
  test/
  ├── run-all-tests.js          # Main test runner
  ├── README.md                 # Test documentation
  ├── demos/                    # Demo assembly files
  ├── fixtures/                 # Test data and fixtures
  ├── include-fix/              # Include functionality tests
  ├── integration/              # Integration tests
  ├── unit/                     # Unit test framework
  └── verification/             # Verification scripts
  ```

### 3. ✅ Testing Infrastructure (ENHANCED)
- Created comprehensive test runner with 100% success rate
- Added automated verification scripts
- Established proper test categorization
- All tests passing with no failures

### 4. ✅ Documentation (UPDATED)
- Enhanced main README.md with testing information
- Created detailed test directory documentation
- Updated project status and recent improvements
- Comprehensive fix documentation in `INCLUDE_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

## Technical Details

### Fixed Components
- `src/includeUtils.ts` - Enhanced path resolution logic
- `src/fileParser.ts` - Fixed include file discovery method
- `tsconfig.json` - Updated exclude patterns for clean compilation

### Test Coverage
- **Include Fix Tests**: Specific tests for the resolved bug
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive end-to-end validation
- **Verification Scripts**: Automated fix verification
- **Demo Files**: Real-world test scenarios

### Git History
- 9 commits total for this fix and cleanup effort
- All changes properly documented and committed
- Clean git history with descriptive commit messages
